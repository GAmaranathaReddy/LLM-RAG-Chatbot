This tutorial is best suited for intermediate Python developers who want to get hands-on experience creating custom chatbots. Aside from intermediate Python knowledge, you’ll benefit from having a high-level understanding of the following concepts and technologies:

- Large language models (LLMs) and [prompt engineering](https://realpython.com/practical-prompt-engineering/)
- [Text embeddings and vector databases](https://realpython.com/chromadb-vector-database/#represent-data-as-vectors)
- [Graph databases](https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-database/) and [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/languages-guides/neo4j-python/)
- [The OpenAI developer ecosystem](https://openai.com/product)
- [REST APIs](https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/) and [FastAPI](https://realpython.com/fastapi-python-web-apis/)
- [Asynchronous programming](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

Nothing listed above is a hard prerequisite, so don’t worry if you don’t feel knowledgeable in any of them. You’ll be introduced to each concept and technology along the way. Besides, there’s no better way to learn these prerequisites than to implement them yourself in this tutorial.
