# Conclusion

Congratulations on completing this in-depth tutorial!

You’ve successfully designed, built, and served a RAG LangChain chatbot that answers questions about a fake hospital system. There are certainly many ways you can improve the chatbot you built in this tutorial, but you now have a sound understanding of how to integrate LangChain with your own data, giving you the creative freedom to build all kinds of custom chatbots.

**In this tutorial, you’ve learned how to:**

- Use **LangChain** to build personalized **chatbots**.
- Create a chatbot for a fake hospital system by aligning with **business requirements** and **leveraging available data**.
- Consider the implementation of **graph databases** in your chatbot design.
- Set up a **Neo4j AuraDB** instance for your project.
- Develop a **RAG** chatbot capable of fetching both **structured** and **unstructured** data from Neo4j.
- Deploy your chatbot using **FastAPI** and **Streamlit**.
